# InventoryWidget
A modular and extremely customizable inventory widget I created for my ICS4U class.

## A Quick Overview...
This game has been created to demonstrate the effectiveness of the inventory widget I have created. Here is how to use it.
- Use W, A, S, D to move up, left, down, or right, respectively
- Objects will randomly spawn, moving over them will remove the object from the world, and add it into your inventory
- The number keys (1, 2, 3, 4...) can be used to select the different slots of the inventory (from left to right)
- Press "p" to drop a single count of the item, and "o" to drop all of the currently selected item

- Width and height of the image you would like to display each slot
- Number of slots the inventory has
- Maximum number of objects each slot can hold
- Font name and size of the numbers
- Scale of the images in comparison to their in-game image size
- Transparency of the inventory widget
- Space between the the edge of the inventory and each slot

## How To Use It...
